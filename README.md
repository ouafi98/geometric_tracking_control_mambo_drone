# geometric_tracking_control_mambo_drone

```
an implementation of a geometric tracking control law on parrot mambo mini-drone using simulink.
The control algorithm was both tested in simulation and on a real drone.

# Prerequisites
```
Matlab r2021a at least.
simulink support package parrot mambo. 

If you don't have Matlab r2021a at least, feel free to reach me I'll downgrade 
the version for you ;-)

```

# How to use ?
```
Open the file parrotMinidroneHover.prj.

A detail pdf showing how to deploy code on a real drone is coming soon.
You can also look for matlab tutorial for doing that.
